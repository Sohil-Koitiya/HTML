   searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed. Additionally, this means they can be created and edited with any text editor or with drawing software.Compared to classic 
   bitmapped image formats such as JPEG or PNG, SVG-format vector images can be rendered at any size without loss of quality and can be easily localized by updating
